<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A lightweight PyQt5-based desktop utility that monitors a selected file for changes and automatically copies updated versions to a destination folder. Designed for users who want to back up or track file changes in real-time with a simple, intuitive UI.

<br>

## Why it was built
While learning Java Servlets in VSCode, I found it tedious to manually copy the .war file to the deployment directory every time I rebuilt the project. So, I created Shade Copy to automate that task and help streamline the workflow.

### Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip installer
- Qt Designer *(optional, but recommended if you want to edit the UI)*
